# Digital-twin-of-feed-drive-and-spindle
Digital twin development for the feed drive and spindle was a key project. I worked on model verification in LabVIEW, deploying a state-space model and comparing its output with real-time data. I tuned parameters for accuracy and developed AI/ML models for fault detection, defect analysis, and RUL prediction
